`mrdisc(8)` is a UNIX compatible implementation of [RFC4286][], the
Multicast Router Discovery Protocol.

The protocol is intended to be a way of informing IGMP/MLD snoopers on a
LAN of multicast capable routers.

When complete, `mrdisc(8)` will be integrated in the SMCRoute, mrouted,
and pimd multicast routing daemons.
